## `<blink>`Welcome!`</blink>`

You've reached the nerdiest facet of my internet presence. I'm currently working on [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) on behalf of [Preset, Inc](http://preset.io/)

In technology, I can usually be found:
* Trying to use the *least* or sometimes *most* CSS I can in a given project (I ♥️ CSS)
* Falling in and out of love with JavaScript frameworks on a roughly 2-year cycle
* Building and fawning over data visualization and related generative art
* Trying to explore the various intersections of design/code/typography/dataviz
* Trying to get designers and engineers to play well together, and use the same box of LEGO

When not staring at a glowing rectangle, I can usually be found doing one of the following things:
* Playing bass (Need a bassist? Inquire within!)
* Enjoying beer (I'm a National BJCP beer judge, and love to talk shop)
* DIY woodworking/electronics/tinkering (Why buy something when you can build it for 4x the price?!)
* ... and above all else, playing with my kiddo
